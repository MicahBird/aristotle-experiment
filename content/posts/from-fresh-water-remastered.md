This album is truly unlike anything that I have listened to for this ranking thus far. The lyrics are very lopsided, you can't really tell what the lead singer is going to say next, which is oddly enduring about this album. This album is what the Patchy the Pirate songs should have been like in SpongeBob (it would have been a lot funnier). I also feel like this album is the perfect length, as if it went on any longer I feel like it would have gotten on my nerves. Overall, this is the kind of album your sailor grandpa would sing along with, but nothing I personally would seek out to listen to.
