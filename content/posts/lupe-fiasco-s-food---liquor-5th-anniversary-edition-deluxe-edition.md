Despite the comically over the top album cover, this wasn't a bad listen. This album sounds like diet A Tribe Called Quest, which is not a bad thing, but the lack of diversity in the lyrics makes most songs feel formulaic. This album would have been B-tier, but then it hits you with the track "Outro" which is more of a 12 minute spoken piece of Lupe Fiasco just shouting out random people, which I find funny, but started to get old fast. 

**Memorable Track:** Daydreamin’ (feat. Jill Scott)

(I like the sample used in this song.)

**Shout out to [ITXDemi](https://itxdemi.bandcamp.com/) for recommending this album!**
