Despite never evening knowing of the game that this soundtrack is from, this is a great listening experience. It feels like an odd mix between *Calum Bowen* and an Animal Crossing soundtrack in the best possible way! If you are not into purely instrumental music, this would be a pass, but if your like me, it's definitely worth a listen.
