This is a cohesive and short EP by the iconic french electronic duo ~~Daft Punk~~ *Justice*. Out of *Justice*'s whole discography, only *Cross* has clicked with me the most, but this was an alright listen. It lacks the iconic sampling that *Justice* is known for, and leans more heavily on the rock end of things. As a result, I think this lands firmly in B-tier for me.
