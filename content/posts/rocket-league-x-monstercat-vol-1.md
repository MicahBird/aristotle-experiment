The only word I can think of to describe this album is "edmslop". I know people who are a fan of this kind of over the top music, but, no diss, this kind of music isn't for me. I sometimes can enjoy this kind of music, but it has to have a common thread or sample hook (such as in [Madeon - Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvhHHtkpRYUYrcSA1GLS4rD73qyDO9GLi)). Every song on this album would not feel out of place in a YouTube Minecraft lets player's intro/outro of a video.

(I internally laughed when this song used the Ray William Johnson equals 3 record scratch as a sample.)
