I went into this album entirely blind, and although that made the experience all the more comedic, it got old fast. I would highly advise that you do the same, and so I shall refrain from spoiling the fun here. I think that this would be a lot more fitting soundtrack for the *Dune* movies. You would have to be built different to listen to this while working out.

**Memorable Track:** Thousander Chant
