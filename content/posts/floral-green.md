This is yet another rock album that was in one ear and out the other. It sounds a lot like if Green Day never graduated high school. The vocals are trying too hard, and was not really any riff that caught my attention. I honestly think that [The Gentle Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hZS3N_FWPI) pulled off this kind of rock aesthetic better than this lot. If the songs didn't stop at the end and just kept going from one to another, I probably could not distinguish when one song ends an another begins. At least this album is on the shorter end of things, so that's a bonus.
