I was truly hoping this was going to be an S-tier album, as the UNDERTALE soundtrack is one of my favorite albums of all time, and this is just remixes?! Sign me up!! 

But boy oh boy is was this album ***extremely*** hit or miss. It felt like every other track it either rocketed straight to S-tier in my heart or sank all the way to D-tier. The sonic whiplash that was listening to *Once Upon a Time (Remixed by grooveman Spot)* was quite the unpleasant departure from what should be a more melody driven piano tune. Also *Enemy Approaching (Remixed by DJ Mitsu the Beats)* felt incredibly off beat, and borderline nauseating as it feels like you can audibly hear the dials being turned for the sweep/flange.

Then on the other hand you have masterpieces like *Another Medium (Remixed by grooveman Spot)* and *Spear of Justice (Remixed by GORO KUMAI)* that perfectly capture the essence of the original songs but put a new spin on them at the same time. The album overall certainly got better as the album went on, but some tracks left a sour taste in my mouth.

**Memorable Track:** *Another Medium (Remixed by grooveman Spot)*

**Recommended by:** Me :) (I searched [Fangamer](https://www.fangamer.com/collections/music) and was shocked to see that this album even existed!)
