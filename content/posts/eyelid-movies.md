This is an electronic album from Phantogram, and only analogy that I can think of is it sounds like if Four Tet produced an LCD Soundsystem album. I personally believe that this album would have been better as a collection of instrumentals, as the lyrics didn't really hook me at any point. As a result I did not feel like the album had any memorable moments or any songs I see myself listening to again. Not offensive, but not an ear worm either.

**Memorable Track:** Turn it Off
