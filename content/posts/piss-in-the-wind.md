This is a new album released by an artist I have never heard of: Joji. I'm personally not a fan of the mumble style lyrics and so this whole album just kinda gets on my nerves. There are some tracks that are more electronic focused that work *better* for me, but nothing I saw my self listening again. The autotune on the track *Rose Colored* was funny to me, but that's probably not what the album intended. I would honestly recommend that anyone who likes this album to just listen to [Tennyson's album: Rot](https://tennyson.bandcamp.com/album/rot).

**Memorable Track:** Sojourn
