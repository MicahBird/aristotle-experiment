This album was a nice departure from the typical electronic album I would listen to, as this was more Jazz-like and slow paced. It feels like something your southern grandparents would listen to when driving (in the best possible way). When singing, Jeb sounds a lot like those fake Peter Griffin impression memes, which makes me chuckle when I think about it, although definitely coincidental. Overall, a good listen, but nothing to drop everything your doing and listen to immediately.
