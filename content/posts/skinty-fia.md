Listening to this was painfully British, and the lead singer so desperately wants to imitate the [lead singer from the *IDLES*](https://idlesband.bandcamp.com/track/dancer), but what comes out of his mouth isn't nearly as intelligent or clever as the *IDLES*. I was also able to mentally predict whatever the lead signer on this album was about to say (albeit, when he is repeating himself), and as a result I did not enjoy it all that much. The ever present reverb also drowns out any lyrics which get's pretty grating the longer you listen. Not an offensive, but not an album I would plan on listening to again anytime soon.
