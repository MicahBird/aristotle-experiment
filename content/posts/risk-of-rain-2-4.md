Even though I have only played Risk of Rain 2 for a collective 20 minutes, Chris Christodoulou knocked it out of the park with this soundtrack. It is the perfect blend of ambient music and electronic that is really my kind of jam, but it is not for everyone. I especially like how *A Glacier Eventually Farts (And Don't You Listen to the Song of Life)* has some spoken piece samples that fit really well. My only real complaints (and thus holding it back from S-tier) are that if the tracks were more condenced I think would be a lot more engaging of a listen. Also some tracks were kinda grating and caused tonal whiplash, such as *Antarctic Oscillation* and *You're Gonna Need a Bigger Ukulele*.
