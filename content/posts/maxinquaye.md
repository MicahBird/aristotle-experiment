Listening to this album was an exercise in restraint. Every fiber of my being wanted to obliterate the skip button just to get it over with. I cannot think of a more fitting word than "wack" for describing most of the beats on this album; I just could not get into any kind of groove with this one. I genuinely think [Yuno Miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2eoFre6m2M) is a better lyricist than whatever drivel is spat out on this album (and at least Yuno Miles makes me laugh ironically). If I had to give some more constructive criticism, the mixing is egregiously bad. For example, the track *Hell Is Around The Corner* initially caught my interest for it's use of a Portishead sample, but lead lyrics is so unbalanced between the left and right channels that I felt like I had something clogging my left ear. I truly hope I never have to listen to this again.

**Memorable Track:** Suffocated Love *(would be decent without any lyrics)*
