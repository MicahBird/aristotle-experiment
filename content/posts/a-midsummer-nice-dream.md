This album feels like it could easily be a video game soundtrack in the best way possible. It is painfully electronic and techno-like, which I really like. However, I feel like some tracks were a bit too repetitive for my liking (which is holding it back from being S-tier), most notably *REM Research Center*. I also like how the title of the album is a tongue and cheek reference to *A Midsummer Night's Dream* (I certainly enjoyed this album infinitely more than that obsolete book).

**Memorable Track:** Drink Malk
