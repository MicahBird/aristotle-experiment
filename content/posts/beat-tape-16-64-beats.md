This album sounds like the perfect fusion of [Madlib's beats](https://madvillain.bandcamp.com/track/all-caps-2) and [Pogo's sampling](https://pogomix.bandcamp.com/track/alice). Honestly I wish that Madlib's standalone albums would be ***this*** good. Some of these samples sound like something [The Avalanches](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVxakxoWul5V3M8awBfeQnboZN_fqkEPS) or [Hugo Kant](https://hugokant.bandcamp.com/album/far-from-home) would use, and that's a compliment in the best possible way. Despite every track being just a little over a minute, I feel like every song conveys the point, and never overstays it's welcome. **I was genuinely floored when I recognized that the song [[05] DOPE](https://jippy.bandcamp.com/track/05-dope) samples one of my favorite artists, [Bonobo](https://bonobomusic.bandcamp.com/track/the-shark)!** This album absolutely is not for everyone, but if you are even the slightest fan of Adult Swim bumper music, this album would be a slam dunk for you.

**Recommended by:** Bryson 

Writer's note: *(Bryson didn't recommend this album specifically, but [the one he did recommend](https://jippy.bandcamp.com/album/the-hydrogen-line) is 3 hours long since every song is named after an element on the Periodic Table, which I find hilarious.)*
