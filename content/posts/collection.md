This album is a chiptune's delight, it sounds like something straight out of a game that doesn't exist. If you are fan of retro music layered with pianos, or really anything made by [aivi & surasshu](https://aivisura.bandcamp.com/track/lonely-rolling-star-composed-by-yoshihito-yano) then this album is worth a listen.
