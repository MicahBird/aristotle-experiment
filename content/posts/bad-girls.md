This album was a groovy departure back to the 70s, and every track feels like it could be used as an opening to some cliche movie. When listening to most of these tracks, I thought, "Wow this would be a lot better if it was just an instrumental", and wouldn't you know it, *Giorgio Moroder* was the producer on the album, so kudos to me I suppose. This album is **rife** with sampling potential, there are so many different drum breaks and vocal parts that I think someone like [*Eliphino*](https://hypercolour-records.bandcamp.com/album/i-dont-care) could make something truly great from it. Otherwise I feel like the album starts strong, but really starts to overstay it's welcome by the time you reach *There Will Always Be A You*. For me personally, this album was entirely in one ear and out the other.

**Memorable Track:** Our Love
