Artist: Douglas Holmquist

A smooth and ambient soundtrack that serves as quite the juxtaposition of the chaotic gameplay of *Teardown*. I can certainly see it as good music while driving, maybe not so much while studying. It certainly doesn't have great replay value, but can be relaxing.

**Memorable Track**: The Chase

**Recommended by:** Me :)
