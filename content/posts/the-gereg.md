This was quite the booming, metal album quite the departure from everything I have listened to so far for this ranking. Although it had groovy moments, this album was mostly in one ear and out the other, as there were not any major riffs or hooks that I could hear myself listening to over and over again. It definitely has it's own ascetic going, and would be incredibly fitting for a soundtrack, but I doubt I will be coming back to this album anytime soon.
