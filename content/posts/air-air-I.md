Certainly a more ambient and trance techno like album. The beginning of the album really had me disinterested, but the track "Arc" turned everything around for me, and it grew on me as it progressed. "Arc" is one of those tracks that sounds like a futuristic Halo-esk lobby music. But the last track "Lost in Passion" absolutely fell flat for me.

**Memorable Track**: Arc
