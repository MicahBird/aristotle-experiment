A great dance/club EP recently released by one artist that I frequently come back to, *Lehto*. Although I do not think there is any earworms on this album, I would say that it is entirely enjoyable, and very DJ-able.

**Memorable Track:** Hold It (I am a sucker for anything that sounds like a Rhodes piano)

**Recommended by:** Me :)
